Dymension is a network of modular blockchains consisting of the Dymension Hub and RollApps. The Dymension Hub is a Cosmos SDK - Tendermint blockchain with its own set of validator nodes. RollApps are modular blockchains that delegate consensus to the Dymension Hub. To learn more about the Dymension network please visit the [docs](https://docs.dymension.xyz/) and reach out to the community/team on [discord](https://discord.gg/dymension).
